"""Vault Diary offline recovery.

Decrypts a downloaded VaultDiary folder (or Vault Diary backup zips, or Google Drive's
"Download" zips of the folder) into plain files:

    OUTPUT/entries/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<title>-<id>.md
    OUTPUT/files/<id>-<original name>

Needs Python 3.9+ and two packages:  pip install cryptography argon2-cffi

Usage:
    python3 recover.py ~/Downloads/VaultDiary -o ~/VaultDiary-recovered
    python3 recover.py backup.zip -o out --words        # use the 24 recovery words

The passphrase / words are asked for interactively. For automation they can be passed in the
VAULTDIARY_PASSPHRASE or VAULTDIARY_WORDS environment variables.

The file format is documented in FORMAT.md. This script deliberately mirrors the export layout
of recovery.html; a test checks both produce identical files from the committed fixture.
